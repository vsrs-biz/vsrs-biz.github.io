    <h3>Museums and galleries</h3>

    If you haven't been, it's definitely worth visiting:
    <ul>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.artic.edu">The Art Institute</b></a>
	(open Monday and then Thursday-Sunday, 11a-5p).
	It's fantastic. Be sure to check out the new modern wing (an '09 Renzo Piano
	addition), and the unmatched collection of
	<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/25/joseph-cornell-wanderlust-royal-academy-exhibition-london">Cornell boxes</a>.
	There will be two exhibits going on during the week of the wedding:
	<a href="https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/9626/igshaan-adams-desire-lines">Igshaan Adams</a>
	(more info about the artist <a href="https://blankprojects.com/Igshaan-Adams-Bio">here</a>)
	and <a href="https://www.artic.edu/exhibitions/9346/mel-bochner-drawings-a-retrospective">Mel Bochner</a>
	(more info about the artist <a href="https://www.simonleegallery.com/artists/mel-bochner/">here</a>). 
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="https://mcachicago.org">The Museum of Contemporary Art</b></a>
	(closed Monday, open 10a-5p except Tuesday, which has extended hours until 9p).
	Yes, that's where the wedding is---and the galleries will be open during the
	wedding. Still, if you want more time to focus on the art, I encourage you
	to visit! The <a href="https://mcachicago.org/exhibitions/2022/nick-cave-forothermore">Nick
	  Cave show</a> (also open during the wedding) will be fantastic.
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="">
      <li><b><a href="https://oi.uchicago.edu">The Oriental Institute</b></a> on
	the U Chicago campus (closed Monday, hours 10a-4p). Selection of Assyrian,
	Anatolian, Egyptian, Nubian, Megiddan, and Persian art. The re-creation of
	an Assyrian courtyard is notable. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    Beyond art, there are other cool cultural institutions:
    <ul>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.fieldmuseum.org">The Field Museum</a></b> (natural history). Famous for its giant T-Rex, Sue.
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.msichicago.org">The Museum of Science and Industry</a></b>. If you want to learn more about
	how static electricity works or how chickens hatch, this is your spot.
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.adlerplanetarium.org">The Adler Planetarium</a></b>. Planetarium. Haven't been in 20+ years, but
	seems popular.
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.sheddaquarium.org">The Shedd Aquarium</a></b>. Awesome aquarium that supports a lot of research
	and rescue operations. Many years ago, the Orcas learned to imitate the sound of a broken
	washing machine because they liked the hubbub of bringing in (confused) repair technicians.
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.czs.org/Brookfield-ZOO/Home">The Brookfield Zoo</a></b>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    
    <h3>Tours and other activities</h3>

    Check out:
    <ul>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.architecture.org/tours/detail/chicago-architecture-foundation-center-river-cruise-aboard-chicago-s-first-lady/">
	    The river architectural tour</b></a> (tickets at link).
	It seems to keep getting better, so worth doing even if you've been before.
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="">The Robie House</b></a> and the University of Chicago campus. Check
	out <a href="">Rockefeller Chapel</a> while you're there. 
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="">Historic Pullman</b></a>.
      </li>
      <li><b><a href=""></b></a>.
    </ul>
      
    
    <h3>Parks and nature</h3>

    This is Fraser writing, so the nature info isn't top notch. But here's
    what I've managed to come up with:
    <ul>
      <li><b>The lake</b>. Lake Michigan is very large and visible e.g., from Lakeshore Drive
	(often abbreviated LSD on roadwork signs). Check out <a href="">The Point</a> if
	you're on the South side, or one of the many <a href="">beaches</a> if you're further
	North. There's also a great running trail alongside the lake. 
      </li>
      <li><b>The dunes</b>. 
      </li>
      <li><b>Millenium Park</b>. Hard to miss if you're downtown, but it's worth walking around, taking
	a picture with The Bean ('03), etc. 
      </li>
    </ul>
