    <h3>Museums and galleries</h3>

    If you haven't been, it's definitely worth visiting:
    <ul>
      <li><b><a href="https://www.artic.edu">The Art Institute</b></a>
	(open Monday and then Thursday-Sunday, 11a-5p).
	It's fantastic. Be sure to check out the new modern wing (an '09 Renzo Piano
	addition), which has a great collection of ....
	There will be two exhibits going on during the week of the wedding:
	<a href="">Igshaan Adams</a> (more info about the artist <a href="">here</a>)
	and <a href="">Mel Bochner</a> (more info about the artist <a href="">here</a>). 
      </li>
      <li><b><a href="https://mcachicago.org">The Museum of Contemporary Art</b></a>
	(closed Monday, open 10a-5p except Tuesday, which has extended hours until 9p).
	Yes, that's where the wedding is---and the galleries will be open during the
	wedding. Still, if you want more time to focus on the art, I encourage you
	to visit! The <a href="https://mcachicago.org/exhibitions/2022/nick-cave-forothermore">Nick
	  Cave show</a> (also open during the wedding) will be fantastic.

    </ul>

      <li><b>The lake</b></li>
      <li><b>Dunes</b></li>
    </ul>
