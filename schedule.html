    <h3>Wedding schedule</h3>

    The wedding goes from 6p-11p on July 16th at the MCA in Chicago.
    We look forward to seeing you there!

    The outdoor ceremony starts at 6p, followed by an outdoor cocktail hour at ~620p.
    Dinner (outdoor) and dancing (indoor) follow the cocktail hour.
    All outdoor activities with the exception of the ceremony are under a tent; in
    case of rain, the ceremony will take place indoors, but the cocktail hour and
    dinner will still take place outdoors.
