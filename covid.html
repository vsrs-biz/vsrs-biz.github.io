      <h3>Covid information</h3>

      We are watching covid cases closely, and will be using the MCA's
      outdoor space if cases are still high. 
      We ask that all guests are vaccinated.
      We would appreciate if guests take an at-home covid test and
      check for a negative result before attneding.
      Thank you all so much!
